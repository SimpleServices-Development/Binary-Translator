# Text-to-Binary and Binary-to-Text Translator

This project is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to seamlessly convert between text and binary. Whether you're exploring binary encoding, debugging, or simply curious about how text is represented in binary form, this translator has you covered.

## Features

- **Text to Binary Conversion**: Input text to generate its binary representation.
- **Binary to Text Conversion**: Input binary (0s and 1s) to decode it back into text.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use with clear input and output for both translations.
- **Efficient and Accurate**: Converts data in real-time with precise results.

## How It Works

1. **Text to Binary**: Each character of the input text is converted to its ASCII value and then represented in binary format.
2. **Binary to Text**: Input binary strings are decoded back into their respective ASCII characters to form the original text.

## Use Cases

- Learning about binary encoding.
- Sending encoded messages for fun.
- Debugging or testing encoding in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python translator.py
   ```

## Example Usage

### Text to Binary
Input:  
`Hello`  
Output:  
`01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`

### Binary to Text
Input:  
`01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`  
Output:  
`H e l l o`

## Future Enhancements

- Build a graphical user interface (GUI) for better accessibility.
- Implement batch processing for large files.
